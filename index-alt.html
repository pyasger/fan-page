        <h2>Best Water</h2>
        <p>There are many ways to drink water.  Water from the city faucet that can have benefits like fluoride and <br>other minerals.   
        <br>But the taste can not be easy to handle. <br> So, now we can have bottles water which sounds really weird now.  <br>i would not have though to drink bottled water before.  But its better then soda. <br> What can make you unhealthy.  Plus, can make you dehydrated.  Why not have a bottle of water?  <br>Drinking soda has been decreasing in years now.  Its at an all time low.  <br>People are moving to less calorie healthy alternative to soda. <br>Who would have though that of drinking water from a bottle.  But the what's the healthy alternative?</p>
